## Description 

This is a express.js application that allows a user to take notes and have them saved to or removed from a database.

## Installation 

Simply clone the repository in your terminal. Package Json and all other relevant modules are already installed and present in the folder.

## Usage

This app is designed to take notes. In order to run this application, user must open the terminal, navigate to the file, and write the command 'node server.js'. The terminal will populate a link to the local host. This link opens in the default browser and displays the application.
